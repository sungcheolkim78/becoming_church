- `히7:7` But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.

- `마6:14-15` For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

- `마10:34-38` Think not that I came to [^Matt10:34a] send peace on the earth: I came not to [^Matt10:34b] send peace, but a sword. For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law: and a man’s foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
[^Matt10:34a]: Matthew 10:34 Greek cast. 
[^Matt10:34b]: Matthew 10:34 Greek cast. 


- `시119:71` It is good for me that I have been afflicted; That I may learn thy statutes.

- `출12:22` And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.

- `갈1:6-9` I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different [^Gal1:6a] gospel; [^Gal1:7a] which is not another gospel : only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the [^Gal1:7b] gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, should [^Gal1:8a] preach [^Gal1:8b] unto you any gospel [^Gal1:8c] other than that which we [^Gal1:8d] preached unto you, let him be anathema. As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man [^Gal1:9a] preacheth unto you any gospel [^Gal1:9b] other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.
[^Gal1:6a]: Galatians 1:6 Greek good tidings. See marginal note on Mt. 4:23. 
[^Gal1:7a]: Galatians 1:7 Or, which is nothing else save that there etc. 
[^Gal1:7b]: Galatians 1:7 Greek good tidings. See verse 6. 
[^Gal1:8a]: Galatians 1:8 See marginal note on Mt. 11:5. 
[^Gal1:8b]: Galatians 1:8 Some ancient authorities omit unto you. 
[^Gal1:8c]: Galatians 1:8 Or, contrary to that 
[^Gal1:8d]: Galatians 1:8 See marginal note on Mt. 11:5. 
[^Gal1:9a]: Galatians 1:9 See marginal note on Mt. 11:5. 
[^Gal1:9b]: Galatians 1:9 Or, contrary to that 


- `창2:24` Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

- `고후11:2-4` For I am jealous over you with [^2Cor11:2a] a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your [^2Cor11:3a] minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different [^2Cor11:4a] gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with him .
[^2Cor11:2a]: 2 Corinthians 11:2 Greek a jealousy of God. 
[^2Cor11:3a]: 2 Corinthians 11:3 Greek thoughts. See 3:14.

- `살전4:3-4` For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication; that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,

- `고전7:14` For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.

- `벧전3:1-6` In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the [^1Pet3:1a] behavior of their wives; beholding your chaste [^1Pet3:2a] behavior coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own [^1Pet3:5a] husbands: as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not [^1Pet3:6a] put in fear by any terror.

[^1Pet3:7a]: 1 Peter 3:7 Greek unto the female vessel, as weaker. 


- `슥2:4-5` and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall [^Zech2:4a] be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein. For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
[^Zech2:4a]: Zechariah 2:4 Or, dwell 


- `마18:18-20` Verily I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it [^Matt18:19a] shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

- `시127:3-5` Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah; And the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.

[^Isa6:3a]: Isaiah 6:3 Hebrew the fulness of the whole earth is his glory. 


- `엡5:33` Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.

- `요17:16-17` They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. [^John17:17a] Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.
[^John17:17a]: John 17:17 Or, Consecrate
